                have a smooth experience when working and getting forms out. The old system ran on Windows 7 and needs serious
                modern capabilities installed all while keeping a simple outlook visually.

        <h3>Q. Which is most efficient, update from old system or create a brand new one?</h3>
        <h3>A. Create a brand new one.</h3>
        <p>The decision to scrap the old system to create a new one came light of the team not wanting to have to
            read through old code and design methods. The system was many moons behind the current trends to where
            the team decided that in order for the system to be up to date, it would be better and faster to create anew rather than 
            revamp and redesigning from the old base system.

        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
        <p>This part of the project has focused on research and identified pain points and needs. Knowing what it is the users wants,
            there is generally a solution for it. Research into modern examples and user personas enabled me to understand the
            target users more in order to figure out the best, most efficient design solution.

            The client, after showing them the prototypes, generally liked how simple and easy to follow the elements are.
